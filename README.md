## Project Description
* Objective: The main objective of this personal data science project is to develop predictive models capable of estimating health insurance costs for individuals. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and techniques, the aim is to create accurate models that can assist in assessing insurance premiums and understanding the impact of different variables on the costs.
  
* Data Source: A dataset with 1338 observations was obtained from Kaggle, containing information such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking habit, and geolocation. The dataset was checked for null values and found to be complete.

* Models Used:
   * Linear Regression Model: Feature engineering was performed to convert categorical variables (gender, smoking habit, and region) into numerical ones. The dataset was split into training and testing sets, and linear regression was applied after scaling the data.
   * Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Regression Model: Constructed using the Keras library, the ANN model consisted of multiple layers with varying activation functions. The model was compiled with the 'mean_squared_error' loss function and optimized using the Adam optimizer. The dataset was split into training and testing sets for model training.
